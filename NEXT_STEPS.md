## Next Steps if i had more time

* Add support for RichText rendering on screens described in `2_lesson_introduction_contentful.json`.
I couldn't find a RichText component for react native, but i think it can be done by converting RichText to HTML and rending the HTML in a webview or HTML renderer.

* Add support for `journalScreen` with text input for user input.

* Add some unit testing on the different components and screens to ensure the correct data and format is rendered.

* Add support for custom fonts defined in the Design Spec.

* Improve cross platform styles for consistency on both android and ios
